        <h2>Ball Bounce Program</h2>
        <p>In this project we used the program known as scratch to create a game where the the player is in control of a blue ball and the goal of the game is to not touch an red 
        lines or any of the yellow or green balls. During this project I worked with the partners Ian Yeung and Daniel Zhong to develop this program. The program was The program for 
        this project was a mixture of complex and simple commands as the code to allow the player to move their avatar was simple the coding required to move the red lines in the 
        second level was much more complex. We used this project as a way to develop our coding skills as well as learning how to work with others in coding.</p>

        <h2>Mole Mash MkII Projct</h2>
        <p>In this project we used the program known as appinventor to create a game where the the player is in control of and has to "whack" on moles 
        to earn points. During this project I worked with the partners Anika Surapaneni and Bronwyn Gordon to develop this program. The program was slightly difficult yet easy at 
        the same time as the base code was already there and all that was required was to modify that code to our needs. It was difficult to organize and plan during the project 
        and modifying it was a mojor challenge. This project help make me realize that communication was extremely important and that applies to computer science heavily because 
        of how computer scinece revolves around information so it is vital to communicate during projects.</p>
