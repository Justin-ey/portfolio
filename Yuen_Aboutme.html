        <p> Hi, my name is Justin Yuen, my dream is to become a computer engineer. I live in Dublin Ca and attend Dublin High School. I plan to take multiple computer classes to 
        help increase my knowledge of computer engineering and computer science and real-life information from my friends and family so I can have a better chance to achieve my goal.
        I wanted to follow this career path because I learned some computer information from my father and learned the usefulness of such skills and hoped to learn them to help 
        become more self-sufficient and help to help others. </p>
        
        <p> Some of my strengths are that I am hardworking and loyal to my almost any task I am given. I always attempt to be supportive and helpful during projects while trying to
        friendly to all my teammates. From constantly working with others I am sometimes unhelpful, however, that does not stop me from trying to be supportive and cooperative with 
        the rest of the groups, there are also times where I do not understand my co-worker's feelings and emotions so that may stall communications. Mostly I assist my teammates 
        in a supportive role.</p>
        
        <p> Some activities I participate in is the Dublin Comic Club. I enjoy working with them and we all enjoy socializing and making our time enjoyable. Some things that I have
        learned from me working with others is that I can successfully work with those who share a common interest with myself. I can usually work well with those I have worked with 
        before, however, I sometimes have difficulty when working with people I do not know. In conclusion, I can work well with most people and I am hardworking and constantly 
        dedicated to whatever task I am currently assisting with. You are more than welcome to look around my website, Enjoy!
